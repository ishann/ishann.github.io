I am a Masters in Computer Science student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu) advised by [Prof. Min Kyung Lee](http://minlee.net). Previously, I graduated with a Masters in Robotics from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) advised by [Prof. Deva Ramanan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~deva/). Before starting graduate school, I worked on biometrics at [IIIT Delhi](http://iab-rubric.org) and spent four wonderful years at the [University of Delhi](http://www.nsut.ac.in/en/home).

My research experience spans applying Machine Learning to computer vision (weakly and webly supervised learning, long-tailed object detection, semantic segmentation, medical imaging, and biometrics) and human-AI interaction (personalized algorithmic management and fair resource allocation). I am interested in the research and development of large-scale AI systems with a focus on personalized Machine Learning and fairness and ethics.
